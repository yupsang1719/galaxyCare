A specialist medical company will assess the information provided in the questionnaire and they will determine whether it is appropriate to provide us with a fitness to work certificate. Any fitness to work certificate is valid for 12 months. Thereafter you will be required to fill in and send to them an update form to renew the fitness to work certificate.  In order to facilitate that process information is usually sent to us and we will forward it to the assessment company. Any copies will only be retained by our screening teams. If however you would prefer to send the information direct to the medical assessment company please let us know and we can arrange this for you.</li>
</ul>

We will initiate that process using data that you have provided as part of your registration process, such as name and address details but we will ask you to provide additional details to complete that process (such as historical address information).

In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
<ul>
 	<li>Where we need to <strong>perform the contract,</strong>we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>

We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). This is particularly the case in relation to our recruitment business where we need to not only share data but also to retain certain historical data in order to assist our clients and our candidates in an effective recruitment process. You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us</li>

</ul>

We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<ol start="5">
 	<li><strong>International transfers</strong></li>

<ol start="6">
 	<li><strong>Data security</strong></li>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<ol start="7">
 	<li><strong>Data retention</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong>How long will you use my personal data for?</strong><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.<br>

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In relation to our recruitment business we will also consider to what extent we have been active with you as part of our recruitment services (such as discussing roles with you or placing you into interviews and/or when we last placed you into a role).
<br>
Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting us.</p>
<ol start="8">
 	<li><strong>Your legal rights</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
<br>
You have the right to:
<br>
<strong>Request access </strong><br>to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
<br>
<strong>Request correction </strong><br> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
<br>
<strong>Request erasure </strong><br> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
<br>
<strong>Object to processing </strong><br> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
<br>
<strong>Request restriction of processing </strong> <br> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
<br>
<strong>Request the transfer </strong><br> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
<br>
<strong>Withdraw consent at any time </strong> <br>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
<br>
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.
<br>
<strong>No fee usually required</strong><br>

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
<br>
<strong>What we may need from you</strong><br>

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
<br>
<strong>Time limit to respond</strong>
<br>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated
